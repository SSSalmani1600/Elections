### Interface Queue with implementation classes LinkedList, ArrayDeque

**Problem or Need Analysis:**

The data in software development often needs to be processed, in a specific order to maintain consistency and efficiency. Systems such as printers, task schedulers and webservers handle multiple requests at a time. Without a proper data structure, the tasks could overlap, be lost or even be executed in the wrong order, leading to performance issues and unreliable results.

The queue interface is important for solving this problem by organizing the elements according to the First In, First Out (FIFO) or Last In, First Out (LIFO) principles. It provides a structured and predictable way of processing data, to ensure that operations occur in the correct sequence (Oracle, 2024).
Understanding the Queue interface and its main implementations, LinkedList and ArrayDeque, is important because these structures are frequently used in many applications. As a developer, it is essential to understand the differences between them to choose the most suitable option for each specific situation. Each of these has different performance characteristics and memory requirements. This research focuses on comparing these two implementations to determine their strengths and weaknesses (JavaGuides, 2023).
To better understand how different Queue implementations behave and perform, this research is guided by a main question and several sub-questions. With these questions were aiming to explore the theoretical and practical aspects of the Queue Interface in Java.
